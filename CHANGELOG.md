### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

#### Shutdown Process Fixed
- **Enhanced Cleanup in `start_app.js`**:
  - Async/await pattern for proper process termination
  - Parallel process killing for faster shutdown
  - Better error handling with timeout fallbacks
  - Windows: Uses `taskkill /T /F` for complete process tree termination
  - Unix: Properly kills process groups with SIGTERM/SIGKILL
  - No more hanging processes requiring Ctrl+C

- **Enhanced Cleanup in `electron-main.js`**:
  - Promise-based cleanup for deterministic shutdown
  - Parallel process termination
  - Improved timeout handling (2 seconds per process)
  - Better logging of cleanup operations
  - Graceful fallback to SIGKILL if SIGTERM fails

#### Code Cleanup
- **Removed Obsolete Backups**:
  - Deleted v1_backup, v2_backup, v3_backup folders
  - Created clean v4_backup before making changes
  - Cleaned up Python cache files (__pycache__)
  - Cleared temporary uploads, models, and results folders

- **File Organization**:
  - Maintained only necessary startup scripts
  - Preserved cross-platform compatibility
  - Cleaned up redundant files
